Building something interesting requires a surplus of time and money. Salaried jobs provide neither. Unless the job itself is your dream, stay the fuck away from them.
A surplus of time and money gives you the chance to make something creative.
surplus of time and money:(extra, more than enough time and money)
he has a surplus of time and money, so he spend his days traveling.

Chiang Mai's food generally contains less meat. After living here for a month, I ordered KFC through Grab. As I ate it, I could feel my body being blessed by the meat. Now, I'm addicted.

"My ridiculous intake of over six cups of coffee daily definitely pushed me over the edge, but it was only the catalyst, not the cause.
https://levels.io/reset-your-life/
pushed me over the edge: "The phrase "pushed me over the edge" typically means that something caused a person to reach their breaking point emotionally, mentally, or in terms of patience. It suggests that the person was already close to their limit, and the event or action pushed them beyond their capacity to cope or remain composed."
自作英文:
"coding 8h straight literally pushed me over the edge.

2025-03-22 14:28:11 +0000: orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
